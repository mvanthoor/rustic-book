Unlike the Rustic Chess engine, the Rustic Book is copyrighted.

[b]This means that text from the Rustic Book may not be re-posted, hosted,
printed, or shown anywhere but for its home on the internet, which is the
website  https://rustic-chess.org/. It is not allowed to reproduce any part
of this work somewhere else in any way without explicit written permission
from the author. The only exception to this are the code snippets, because
they have been pulled directly from the open source Rustic chess

However, this is still a digital work. It can be treated differently than a
paper book. I welcome contributions to the book, for example:
- Fixing spelling mistakes.
- Fixing grammar errors.
- Change the text for better clarification.
- Write a chapter or a section if you'd like to.
- Contribute illustrations, diagrams, etc.

When making a contribution, take into account that:
- You won't be granted copyright over any part of the book, not even the
  contribution itself.
- However, you will receive credits in the text.
- I might somehow change the contribution before including it.
- I might decide to not include it at all for whatever reason.

Thanks for your understanding. I hope this work may be of use to you,
particularly in combination with the Rustic Chess Engine code.
