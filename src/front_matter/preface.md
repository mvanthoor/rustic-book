# Preface

Hi there. Nice to see you hanging around. Welcome to the wonderful world of
chess programming. This can be a very challenging hobby (maybe _addiction_
is the better word), but after you overcome these challenges and see your
chess engine play its first full game, you have created something to be
proud of.

"But... wait", I hear you asking, "hasn't this chess programming thing been
done before?" You're right: if you write your own chess engine from
scratch, you become part of a great history, that already started at the
dawn of the computer age in the early 1950's. Many chess programmers came
before you, and many will come after. Even though at the time of this
writing in 2021 there are hundreds of chess engines available, there is
still merit in writing one's own. The reasons why people write their own
chess engine are extensive. Some of them can be:

1. Studying computer science concepts.
2. Learning a new programming language.
3. To have their own engine to play against.
4. As a prelude to get into machine learning.
5. To compete with other engine authors.
6. And many others.

There is always something new to learn, and one more thing to program when
maintaining a chess engine. There are engines that have been in development
for over 25 years, and they are still improving. Therefore writing a chess
engine does not have to be a project you just start, plan, create and
finish; it can be a journey that last for decades, if you want it to.

Welcome on the long road towards your own chess engine, and good luck!
