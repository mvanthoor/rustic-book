# January 19, 2024 - Fixing Undefined Behavior

![Finally. IT's done](../../img/ramblings/2024/its_done.jpg)

So what's this all about? Well, Rustic has had a dirty little secret since
its very first Alpha 1 version: despite using safe Rust being a top
priority for the engine, Rustic has had a little bit of unsafe code tucked
away in a dark corner somewhere. That in itself isn't that big of a deal,
but in this case, this unsafe code expected a certain outcome, where Rust
defines this outcome as undefined behavior. That's bad.

Why? Because it isn't called "Undefined Behavior" for nothing. It means
that you're depending on a behavior of which the compiler deems that it
should not exist. This can cause trouble with newer versions of the
compiler, or when enabling optimizations.

People coming from C or C++ may already recognize this. You may have been
in this situation yourself. For example, have you ever encountered the
weird problem that a program suddenly doesn't work right, when turning on
the -O2 or -O3 optimizations in GCC, while it _does_ work as expected when
leaving out or only basic optimization? That happens when the program
depends on a characteristic of the non-optimized compile, which changes
when optimizations are turned on at a certain level. That's why it's called
"undefined behavior." I also know of a at least one chess engine that is
being developed and compiled with a very old version of GCC, because newer
versions fixed an undefined behavior the engine depends upon; in other
words, when compiling that engine with newer versions of GCC, it won't work
right.

Where did Rustic suffer from this? The problem was in the move list. When
first developing Rustic, it was very slow compared to what I was expecting.
After profiling and researching, the problem turned out to be in the
creation of the move list. It is best to create a move list in an array,
backed by a counter, as compared to just using a vector. The reason is that
an array is created on the stack, while a vector lives on the heap. The
array is faster to set up. However, Rust requires that all variables need
to be initialized before they are used. Therefore, when creating an array
to hold 255 moves, Rust declares the memory and writes a 0 into each
location. After that, the move generator runs, it will be overwriting 30 or
40 zero's, so it is doing lots of double work.

The solution is to get Rust to create the array without initializing it. My
first attempt in Rustic Alpha 1 looked like this:

```rust,ignore
type TMoveList = [Move; MAX_LEGAL_MOVES as usize];
type RawMoveList = MaybeUninit<TMoveList>;

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct MoveList {
    list: TMoveList,
    count: u8,
}

impl MoveList {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            list: unsafe { RawMoveList::uninit().assume_init() },
            count: 0,
        }
    }
}
```

The RawMoveList is an array of TMoveList, which contains Move elements. The
RawMoveList may not be initialized. When creating the MoveList struct, the
'list' member gets set to an 'assumed initialized version' of the
RawMoveList. This is obviously not true. The 'list' member is of this type:

```rust, ignore
type TMoveList = [Move; MAX_LEGAL_MOVES as usize]
```

And the RawMoveList is of this type:

```rust, ignore
type RawMoveList = MaybeUninit<TMoveList>;
```

What I'm  stating in the constructor of MoveList basically says: take an
uninitialized version of RawMoveList, assume it is initialized, and put it
into the 'list' member of type TMoveList.

The idea behind this is that the move list does not _have_ to be
initialized, because the move generator will receive this list and then
write its moves into it. From the viewpoint of Rust however, this is
undefined behavior: at the end of the constructor, the 'list' member is not
initialized even though we say it is. Rust warns about this, because the
compiler may run optimizations on the 'list' member _as if it was
initialized_, and those optimizations may not work because actually, the
list _wasn't_ initialized. In the past this was only a warning, but in
current Rust versions, using MaybeUnit like this is an error.

I got around it by doing this:

```rust,ignore
impl MoveList {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            list: unsafe {
                let block = RawMoveList::uninit();
                
                // Initialization should be here!
                
                block.assume_init()
            },
            count: 0,
        }
    }
}
```

This obviously isn't the solution, because this works in exactly the same
way as the previous version. The only difference is that the compiler and
linter don't complain about it, because the uninit() and assume_init()
calls are split up. I imagine that later versions of Rust will be able to
detect that no initialization happens between these two calls and the error
message about undefined behavior will return.

In Rustic 4-beta I finally took the time to fixing it:

```rust, ignore
type MoveListArray = [Move; MAX_LEGAL_MOVES as usize];
pub type MoveListRaw = [MaybeUninit<Move>; MAX_LEGAL_MOVES as usize];

pub fn allocate_move_list_memory() -> MoveListRaw {
    unsafe { MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init() }
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct MoveList {
    list: MoveListArray,
    count: u8,
}

impl MoveList {
    pub fn new(raw: &MoveListRaw, count: u8) -> Self {
        Self {
            list: unsafe { mem::transmute::<_, MoveListArray>(*raw) },
            count,
        }
    }
}
```

TMoveList has been renamed to MoveListArray. This is a normal array holding
Move elements. MoveListRaw is now a public type, and contains move list
elements that have possibly not been initialized. This is different from
the previous version. Compare them:

```rust, ignore
// old
type RawMoveList = MaybeUninit<[Move; MAX_LEGAL_MOVES as usize]>;

// new
pub type MoveListRaw = [MaybeUninit<Move>; MAX_LEGAL_MOVES as usize];
```

In the old version, we had an uninitialized array that was filled with Move
elements. Now we have an array, that is filled with uninitialized Move
elements. So now its the elements that aren't initialized, not the entire
array.

Now we can do this:

```rust, ignore
pub fn allocate_move_list_memory() -> MoveListRaw {
    unsafe { MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init() }
}
```

So why can these calls now be chained without issue? Because we are working
with a MoveListRaw, of type _[MaybeUninit<Move>; 255]_. What we are
returning here is an array initialized with elements that are possibly not
initialized. Therefore the compiler knows to not touch that array with
optimizations, because it's elements are possibly not initialized yet, and
thus can't be optimized.

We use it in this way:

```rust,ignore
let mut memory = allocate_move_list_memory();
let mut move_list = move_gen.generate_moves(..., &mut memory, ...);
```

'memory' holds this raw move list that is initialized with possibly
uninitialized elements. We pass this 'memory' variable into the move
generator. There, we obviously had to replace all "MoveList" types with
"MoveListRaw", because that is what the move generator needs to accept now.
In the move generator itself, we only have to change two lines, from this:

```rust, ignore
list.push(Move::new(move_data));
list.push(Move::new(move_data | promotion_piece))
```

To this:

```rust,ignore
memory[*count as usize].write(Move::new(move_data));
memory[*count as usize].write(Move::new(move_data | promotion_piece));
```

And we need to count the moves that are added. Why? Because we are no
longer working with the MoveList struct; we are working with an array
containing uninitialized Move elements. So instead of pushing moves into
the array, we now need to write the data into it. What write() does, is put
the Move data into the MaybeUninit<T> struct, so the MaybeUninit is now
initialized.

At the end of the function generate_moves() we can now say:

```rust, ignore
self.init_unused_part_of(memory, count);
MoveList::new(memory, count)

pub fn init_unused_part_of(&self, memory: &mut MoveListRaw, count: u8) {
    for i in count..MAX_LEGAL_MOVES {
        memory[i as usize].write(Move::new(0));
    }
}
```

This writes Moves with 0 data into the part of the MoveListRaw we are not
using, and then we return a new, proper MoveList struct from the
move_generator() function. The constructor does this:

```rust, ignore
impl MoveList {
    pub fn new(raw: &MoveListRaw, count: u8) -> Self {
        Self {
            list: unsafe { mem::transmute::<_, MoveListArray>(*raw) },
            count,
        }
    }
}
```

It "transmutes" the incoming MoveListRaw into a MoveListArray. Remember,
MoveListRaw and MoveListArray are basically the same type, except that
MoveListRaw says that the elements of the array MaybeUninit<Move>, instead
of Move. MaybeUninit<T> guarantees that the memory layout is exactly the
same as that of T, so what transmute basically does, is stripping the
MaybeUninit from the array's elements, which makes the elements now
correctly initialized.

Why all of these shenanigans? Well, if you just have Rust create a new
MoveList, it will fill the array with zero's, after which the move
generator is going to write its own moves into it. This is double work, and
it happens in the hottest part oof the code, which slows down the engine
significantly. Doing this by using MaybeUninit<T>, we lose a bit of speed
because of the transmute function, but this loss is far outweighed by the
speed we gain by not doing double work millions of times very second.

Now, get out of here and write some more chess engine code.
