# Ramblings

Welcome to the new Ramblings section. In here you will find some thoughts
on subjects that have to do with the development of Rustic and chess
programming in general, but which are not part of the main book. If there
is something mildly interesting to share about Rustic's development which
cannot be fitted in one of the main chapters then you'll find it here.
