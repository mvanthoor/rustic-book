# Rustic Chess Engine book

>**Please note that unlike the Rustic Chess Engine, the Rustic Book is
copyrighted. [See the License for more information about
this.](https://github.com/mvanthoor/rustic-book?tab=License-1-ov-file)**

Welcome to the Rustic Book GitHub repository. This is the place where all
information regarding the creation of Rustic is collected. First, let's get
something out of the way: This book is **not** a step-by-step tutorial on
"How to write a chess engine in Rust." It is a book on chess programming
topics. It discusses these topics one at a time and how these were used to
create the Rustic Chess Engine. It also contains information about Rustic's
design and inner workings wherever this information is useful to have.

Even though Rustic itself and the examples throughout this book are written
in Rust, it should be possible to write a chess engine in any desired
language if all the topics are sufficiently well understood.

I hope this book and the Rustic chess engine itself can help you on your
chess programming journey. Good luck, and I'd appreciate it if you left
some credits in your newly minted engine if any of this material was useful
to you.
