# Further study

Parts of this book are based on explanations given in other resources. As
said on the _About this book_ page, it is impossible for me to list every
resource or webpage I ever visited while creating Rustic, but I can list
materials I've found to be particularly useful. Some of that material may
even have been created _after_ Rustic's first version was finished. Often
it was still useful to me, because it approached some topics at a different
angle than I did myself.
