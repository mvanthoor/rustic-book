# Preface

Hi there. Nice of you to hang around. I'm Marcel, the author of the chess
engine Rustic and the writer of this text. You're about to step into the
wonderful and sometimes aggravating world of chess programming. This can be
a rewarding endavour... but maybe _addictive_ is the better word. There
will be lots of challenges, but with perseverance you'll be able to
overcome them one at a time. When you reach the point where your chess
engine is capable of playing its first full game against yourself or
another engine, you will have created something to be proud of.

"But... wait", I hear you asking, "hasn't this chess programming thing been
done before?" You're right. It has been done before; many times, in fact.
If you write your own engine from scratch, you will become part of a long
history and tradition which already started at the dawn of the computer age
in the early 1950's. Many chess programmers came before and many will come
after. Even though hundreds of engines already exist at this time of
writing in 2021, there is still merit in writing your own. The reasons why
people do this are extensive. Some of those reasons can be:

1. Studying computer science concepts.
2. Learning a new programming language.
3. To have their own engine to play against.
4. As a prelude to get into machine learning.
5. To compete with other engines and authors.
6. And many others.

During the design and writing of a chess engine (or any non-trivial
software project for that matter) there is always something new to learn,
one more feature to add, or another bug to fix. Some engines have been in
development for 25 years or more and they are still improving in one way or
another. This does not have to be a project you just start, plan, create
and finish like any other; it can be a journey and a hobby that may last
for decades, if you want it to.

Welcome on the long road towards writing your very own chess engine.

Good luck and have fun,<br />
Marcel
