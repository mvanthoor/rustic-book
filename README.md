# Rustic Chess Engine book

>**Please note that unlike the Rustic Chess Engine, the Rustic Book is

This book is _not_ a step-by-step tutorial on "How to write a chess engine
in Rust." It is a book about chess programming topics. It discusses these
topics one at a time and how these were used to create the Rustic Chess
Engine. It contains information about Rustic's design and inner workings
and about all the parts needed to create a working working engine.

Even though Rustic itself is written in Rust and the code examples in this
book are written in this language as well, it should be possible to write a
chess engine in any desired language if all the topics are sufficiently
well understood.

I hope this book and the Rustic chess engine itself can help you on your
chess programming journey. Good luck, and I'd appreciate it if you left
some credits in your newly minted engine if any of this material was useful
to you.
