# Preface

Hi there. Nice to see you hanging around. You are about to step into the
wonderful (and sometimes, aggravating) world of chess programming. This can
be a rewarding endavour; but maybe _addictive_ is the better word. There
will be lots of challenges, but you will overcome them one at a time, to
reach the point of seeing your chess engine play its first full game
against another engine, or yourself. You will have created something to be
proud of.

"But... wait", I hear you asking, "hasn't this chess programming thing been
done before?" You're right: if you write your own chess engine from
scratch, you become part of a long history and tradition, which already
started at the dawn of the computer age in the early 1950's. Many chess
programmers came before you, and many will come after. Even though at the
time of this writing in 2021 there are hundreds of chess engines available,
there is still merit in writing your own. The reasons why people write
their own chess engine are extensive. Some of them can be:

1. Studying computer science concepts.
2. Learning a new programming language.
3. To have their own engine to play against.
4. As a prelude to get into machine learning.
5. To compete with other engine authors.
6. And many others.

When writing a chess engine, there is always something new to learn, one
more feature to add, or another bug to fix. Some engines have been in
development for over 25 years, and they are still improving. This does not
have to be a project you just start, plan, create and finish like any
other; it can be a journey and a hobby that can last for decades, if you
want it to.

Welcome on the long road towards your own chess engine, and good luck!
